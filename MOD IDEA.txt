cache ender chest
view it anywhere, cant use it obv

keybind to open menu, settings button in corner // i currently have no uses:
	change keybind here //FAPI handled it: no issues here
	other stuff // no ideas here, open an issue if you do
	set when reset cache? (worldload, timer) // i dont see any worthwhile points for this to take effect at, but if you can think of any, open an issue
detection might have to be based on text at top of chest? // it is, if you have a better approach, open an issue
which may be manipulated by serverside stuff

# Cache My Enderchest

This clientside Minecraft Fabric mod will save the state your enderchest was in when you last opened it. 
You can then access this cached state with any keybind you set in the vanilla keybinds menu. 
You cannot add or withdraw items from this cache, but the viewer should help you remember what is in your enderchest, which is the purpose of this mod.
